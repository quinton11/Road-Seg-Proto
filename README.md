# Road_Seg-Proto
Collection of Notebooks demonstrating my attempts at building and training vision models for license plate detection and road segmentation.
For each task there is a pytorch and tensorflow implementation.

**NB**
- Concerning the road segmentation task, data was preprocessed in the `analyze_data.ipynb` notebook and the resulting data stored in `road_segm.csvs`
